## Data analysis

<p style="font-size:18px; color: grey;">In the 'Analysis' page you can visualize the data, perform the statistical analyses, and generate reports. You can select filter type and time. You can click the 'Edit Inputs' button when you want to go back to the 'Inputs' page to modify the analysis options or upload new data. The 'Analysis' page also contains four tabs called 'Clusters', 'Associations', 'Predictions' and 'Report' that include tables and plots with the results.</p>
