## Welcome !

<p style="font-size:18px;">MSApp is a Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Multivariate Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Disease Data, identify dengue clusters, provide short-term prediction and assess potential risk factors.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">The application allows to fit Bayesian disease models to identify spatial patterns for clustering areas and estimate one-month prediction while properly accounting for spatiotemporal autocorrelation to assess the association of risk factors by using R-INLA.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">The application allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations such as maps supporting padding and zooming and tables that allow for filtering. It also enables the generation of reports containing the analyses performed.</p>
